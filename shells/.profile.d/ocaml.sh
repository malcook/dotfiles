# 1. To configure OPAM in the current shell session, you need to run:

#       eval `opam config env`

# 2. To correctly configure OPAM for subsequent use, add the following
# line to your profile file (for instance ~/.bash_profile):

       . /home/mec/.opam/opam-init/init.sh > /dev/null 2> /dev/null || true

# 3. To avoid issues related to non-system installations of `ocamlfind`
#   add the following lines to ~/.ocamlinit (create it if necessary):

#       let () =
#         try Topdirs.dir_directory (Sys.getenv "OCAML_TOPLEVEL_PATH")
#         with Not_found -> ()
#       ;;
